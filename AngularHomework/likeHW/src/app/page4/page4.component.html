<div>
    <h1>Angular NgZone
    </h1>
    <p>Using Zones is a great way to escape Angularâ€™s change detection, without detaching change detectors and making the application code too complex.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common use of this NgZone is to improve the performance of the page when starting a work consisting of one or more asynchronous tasks that don't require UI updates or error handling to be handled by Angular.
